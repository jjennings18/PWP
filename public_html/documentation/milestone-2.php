		<p>For my pwp website I plan on taking a simple but elegant approach. I want a nice professional displayed of myself.
		I would also like to have a breif but detailed description of my background and training in this field.
			I then plan on having a section towards the bottom of the page that list skills and services I can offer, and next to that
		a "contact info" section. Lastly I plan on pulling it all together with a nice background and/or color and a few different style
		fonts. Lastly I would like to see If I could possibly throw in an animation or transition if possible. </p>
