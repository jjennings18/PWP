		her own photography company. Melissa has established herself so well in the community that she is
		responsible for taking student and sport team photos for several of the local public schools in the city,
		in addition to doing side projects (weddings photos,family photos,etc.).</p>
		<p>Recently Melissa has been searching for someone to build a website for her business. She has a business page
			on Facebook but wants to shift over to something that's more professional,independent,
			and has more flexibility. Melissa says she wants something that can give a run down of her photography
			experience and background. She will also want to have different pages for things like contact info and n email
			submit section. Melissa would also like to have a page on her website where she can showcase work she has done
			for potential clients to view and sample. She says if possible she would also like to have a section that
			displays a calendar with her availability for the month.
