## Milestone 1 Feedback
Even though your Purpose says "employers", it really sounds like you're looking to work freelance and attract potential *clients* instead.

This is great direction, and it sounds like you're looking to work with very small owner-operator/sole-proprietor types that are new to online marketing. This is a valid niche to target, and your main competitors would likely be sites like Squarespace, Wix, Shopify, Wordpress.com, etc.

**Knowing these things, what important design and content choices could you make for your PWP?** This is what Milestone 2a is all about. Your persona describes a creative type with some technical skill (photographer)... so I'm thinking that this is *generally* the kind of client you would like to work with - someone that has a small creative business, possibly home-based. **If you want to specifically target photographers as potential clients**, be aware that they will have some very specific wants and needs regarding a website. Complex photo galleries, cutting edge design that is cohesive with existing branding, social media integration (especially with photo gallery), blogging, secure client login, etc. These are some things to be aware of that could influence your design and content choices for PWP.

The first thing that comes to my mind about your PWP is that the look and feel of your project needs to be engaging, sharp and **professional** from a design perspective. If you are interested in working with creative types, then excellent imagery and design will go a long way to attracting those kinds of clients. The kind of client described in your Persona also likely uses multiple social media platforms to market their business, so your PWP layout should be flawless on mobile.
