## Milestone 1 Feedback
Even though your Purpose says "employers", it really sounds like you're looking to work freelance and attract potential *clients* instead.

This is great direction, and it sounds like you're looking to work with very small owner-operator/sole-proprietor types that are new to online marketing. This is a valid niche to target, and your main competitors would likely be sites like Squarespace, Wix, Shopify, Wordpress.com, etc.

**Knowing these things, what important design and content choices could you make for your PWP?** This is what Milestone 2a is all about. Your persona describes a creative type with some technical skill (photographer)... so I'm thinking that this is *generally* the kind of client you would like to work with - someone that has a small creative business, possibly home-based. **If you want to specifically target photographers as potential clients**, be aware that they will have some very specific wants and needs regarding a website. Complex photo galleries, cutting edge design that is cohesive with existing branding, social media integration (especially with photo gallery), blogging, secure client login, etc. These are some things to be aware of that could influence your design and content choices for PWP.

The first thing that comes to my mind about your PWP is that the look and feel of your project needs to be engaging, sharp and **professional** from a design perspective. If you are interested in working with creative types, then excellent imagery and design will go a long way to attracting those kinds of clients. The kind of client described in your Persona also likely uses multiple social media platforms to market their business, so your PWP layout should be flawless on mobile.

Remember to keep things simple and straightforward due to the narrow scope of our class projects.

When you think about the content you plan to feature on your PWP, what do you think will resonate with the clients you want to work with? 

Overall, nice work here. You've done a great job outlining your purpose/audeince/goal and Persona thoughtfully and in detail. Your project is also set up correctly according to spec. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Please see Edits &amp; Suggestions below for a list of some minor technical issues. You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/)

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- HTML is indented incorrectly. Be careful about this, and be sure to indent child elements correctly going forward.
- line 1 in your .gitinore should be `.DS_Store` (the dot is missing)

Your desktop wireframe looks simple and well broken up, which is great. Your mobile wireframe looks great as well, however, when you put two columns next to each other on a mobile device it usually doesn't end well. For the purposes of PWP I advise you to put your skills and talents in a separate row, which will fall above your contact form. Speaking of contact form, it seems as though you're putting text in your contact info section, when in reality it's going to be a form with input fields that people will fill out and send to you via e-mail. I just wanted to point that out, in case there's any confusion.

According to [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~jjennings18%2Fpwp%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-2.php%2Fmilestone2.php) you're missing alt attributes on both of your images. It's advised to always include alt attributes on all images, as it helps for semantic purposes as well as with search engines.

Your directory structure needs a little love. When it comes time to begin coding your actual PWP you're going to have to separate your files depending on the type, such as CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Images. While your images are fine being in the same directory as your milestone2a.php, we prefer the images to be in a subdirectory titled `images`. Directory structure is a huge deal when working on projects. As projects get larger in scope it becomes increasingly important to separate files logically in order to find them quicker in the future.

Overall it seems as though you've put a lot of thought into the flow of your site, and the end users you'll be trying to attract. Both of which will be tremendously important when it comes time to create and style your PWP. Aside from the suggestions above you've done a great job, and are passing with a [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're free to begin working your PWP!
